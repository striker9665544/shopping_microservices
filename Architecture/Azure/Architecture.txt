Why This is the Industry Standard, Piece by Piece (The Azure Version)
The same five principles make this the standard, just with Azure services.


Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform:
The Standard: Manually clicking in the Azure Portal is unacceptable for serious projects. Terraform is the dominant, cloud-agnostic tool for defining all Azure resources in code.

The Business Reason: Repeatability, Auditability, and Disaster Recovery are identical business drivers.


Multi-Subscription/Management Group Strategy:

The Standard (Azure Equivalent): Putting Dev, QA, and Prod into a single Azure Subscription is a major anti-pattern. The standard is to use separate Azure Subscriptions for each environment/project, organized under Azure Management Groups.

The Business Reason:
	Security & Blast Radius: A breach or misconfiguration in a Dev Subscription is completely isolated and cannot affect your Production Subscription.
	Cost Management & Governance: Subscriptions are the primary unit for billing and applying Azure Policy for governance.
	Simplified Permissions: Using Azure AD and RBAC, it's much easier to grant broad permissions to developers in their Dev Subscription than to create complex roles in a shared one.


CI/CD Automation with GitOps (Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions):
	The Standard: Manual deployments are not viable. An automated pipeline triggered by git push, using Git as the source of truth, is the standard.
	The Business Reason: Velocity, Reliability, and Traceability are universal benefits.


Containerization and Orchestration (Docker & Azure Kubernetes Service - AKS):

	The Standard: Docker with AKS is the de-facto standard on Azure for deploying and managing microservices at scale.

	The Business Reason: Portability, Scalability, Resilience, and Efficiency are the core benefits of Kubernetes on any cloud.


Decoupled Frontend Architecture (Azure Storage + Azure CDN):

	The Standard: For modern SPAs, decoupling the frontend is the standard. The Azure native way is to use Azure Blob Storage to host the static files and Azure CDN to deliver them globally.

	The Business Reason: Global Performance, Cost Efficiency, and Team Independence are achieved just as with the AWS equivalent.

A More Precise and Complete Step-by-Step Plan for Azure
Here is the translation of your detailed AWS plan into its Azure equivalent.

Phase 1: Foundational Azure and Terraform Setup

Module 0: Azure Governance with Management Groups and Subscriptions

Objective: To create the top-level "organizer" using Azure's governance structure.
	Establish Root Management Group: Your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Tenant comes with a top-level "Tenant root group."

	Create Management Groups: Under the root, create Management Groups that mirror your organizational structure: MG-Project-A and MG-Project-B.
	Create Subscriptions: A Subscription is the Azure equivalent of an AWS Account. Inside each Management Group, create a set of Subscriptions for your environments:
		Under MG-Project-A: Create Subscriptions ProjectA-Dev, ProjectA-QA, ProjectA-Prod.
		Under MG-Project-B: Create Subscriptions ProjectB-Dev, ProjectB-QA, ProjectB-Prod.

Apply Azure Policy: Attach Azure Policy definitions to the Management Groups to enforce guardrails. For example, create a policy that denies the creation of public IP addresses on VMs for all subscriptions under that group.


Module 1: Terraform Code Structure and Remote State

Objective: To set up a professional Git and Terraform workflow.

Create Git Repositories: This is identical.
	terraform-modules: For your reusable Azure modules.
	live-infrastructure: For your environment-specific configurations.

Configure Remote State: For each environment, configure Terraform to store its state file remotely in an Azure Storage Account.
In live-infrastructure/project-a/prod/backend.tf:

terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "rg-tfstate-prod"
    storage_account_name = "tfstateprodprojecta123"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "project-a/prod/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}


Phase 2: Reusable Infrastructure Modules (The Azure "LEGO Bricks")

Module 2: Custom Virtual Network (VNet) and Networking

Objective: To create a secure, custom network foundation.

Terraform Resources:
	azurerm_virtual_network, azurerm_subnet (for public and private subnets), azurerm_public_ip, azurerm_nat_gateway, azurerm_route_table.

Critical Logging:
	NSG Flow Logs: Enable Flow Logs on the Network Security Groups (NSGs) associated with your subnets. Configure them to send logs to a central Azure Log Analytics Workspace. This is the Azure equivalent of VPC Flow Logs to CloudWatch.


Module 3: AKS Cluster

Objective: To create a reusable module for a production-ready Kubernetes cluster.

Terraform Resources:
	azurerm_kubernetes_cluster (AKS): The Kubernetes control plane.
	azurerm_kubernetes_cluster_node_pool: The Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) that act as worker nodes, configured to launch only in the private subnets.

Critical Logging:
	Within the azurerm_kubernetes_cluster resource, enable the Azure Monitor for containers addon. This sends all control plane logs, metrics, and application logs to a central Log Analytics Workspace.


Module 4: Frontend Hosting and Delivery (Storage/CDN/DNS)

Objective: To build the hosting platform for the frontend application.

Terraform Resources:
	azurerm_storage_account and azurerm_storage_container: To store the static HTML/CSS/JS files. The container should be configured for static website hosting.
	azurerm_cdn_profile and azurerm_cdn_endpoint: The CDN that sits in front of the storage account.
	azurerm_dns_zone and azurerm_dns_a_record: To manage your DNS and point www.your-app.com to the Azure CDN endpoint.


Module 5: Backend State and Services (Azure SQL/ACR)

Objective: To provision the stateful services for your backend.

Terraform Resources:
	Azure SQL Database (azuresql module): Creates an azurerm_sql_server and azurerm_sql_database. Use Private Endpoints to ensure it's only accessible from within your private VNet, and configure firewall rules to only allow access from your AKS cluster's subnets.
	ACR Repositories (acr module): Create a single azurerm_container_registry (ACR) per project. Unlike ECR, a single ACR can contain repositories for all your microservices.


Phase 3: Application Deployment and Automation

Module 6: Kubernetes Core Services Deployment (Helm)
Objective: To deploy foundational services inside AKS.

1. Ingress Controller:
	What: The Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC).
	Why: This controller watches Kubernetes Ingress objects and automatically configures an Azure Application Gateway (the L7 load balancer) in your public subnet to route traffic into the cluster.

2. Observability Stack (Logging & Metrics):
	What: A chart bundling Prometheus, Grafana, and Fluent Bit.
	Why: Fluent Bit scrapes pod logs and forwards them to your central Azure Log Analytics Workspace, giving you one place to search and analyze everything.

3. API Gateway (The Azure Way):
	What: Use Terraform to deploy an Azure API Management (APIM) instance. This is a powerful, managed PaaS gateway.
	Why: The Azure Application Gateway forwards traffic to APIM. APIM then handles authentication (e.g., validating JWTs), rate-limiting, caching, and then securely routes requests to the correct service pods inside the private AKS cluster. This is the more robust and idiomatic Azure pattern.


Module 7: Microservice Application Deployment (Terraform + Helm)

Objective: To deploy your custom applications. This module's code is virtually identical to the AWS version, as the helm_release provider is cloud-agnostic.

In your live-infrastructure/project-a/prod/main.tf:

# Deploy the Mobile Service using its Helm Chart
resource "helm_release" "mobile_service" {
  name  = "mobile-service"
  chart = "./charts/microservice"

  values = [
    yamlencode({
      name = "mobile-service"
      image = {
        # Note the different repository format for ACR
        repository = "${module.acr.login_server}/mobile-service"
        tag        = var.mobile_service_image_tag # From CI/CD
      }
      replicaCount = 5
    })
  ]
}


Module 8: The CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions)

Objective: To fully automate the deployment lifecycle.

Clarification on "Pipeline 3": The backend pipeline is your IaC pipeline. There is no separate "Pipeline 3". You have two pipelines for two distinct application types (Frontend and Backend).

Pipeline 1: Frontend Application CI/CD

Trigger: On push to the frontend repo.

Build: Run npm install and npm run build.

Deploy: Use the Azure CLI to run az storage blob upload-batch -s ./build -d '$web' --account-name <your-storage-account>.

Invalidate CDN: Run az cdn endpoint purge to tell Azure CDN to fetch the new files.


Pipeline 2: Backend Microservice CI/CD (This IS the IaC Pipeline)

Trigger: On push to a backend microservice repo.

Build & Test: Run application tests.

Build & Push Docker Image: Build a Docker image and push it to the Azure Container Registry (ACR) with the Git commit SHA as the tag.

Trigger Terraform: The pipeline checks out the live-infrastructure repo. It authenticates to Azure using a Service Principal. It then runs terraform 
apply -auto-approve -var="mobile_service_image_tag=a1b2c3d".

Result: Terraform executes a helm upgrade, and AKS performs a zero-downtime rolling update of the Mobile POD. Your new code is live.
