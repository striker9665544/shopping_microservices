Next Steps (The "End Goal" Plan)
After you have completed the modifications above, your project will be ready. The next steps will be to create the new infrastructure services one by one:
Create the config-server Project: Set up a Git repository for your configurations.
Create the service-registry (Eureka Server) Project: This will be a simple Spring Boot app with the @EnableEurekaServer annotation.
Create the api-gateway Project: Configure its routing rules to point to the service names (e.g., mobile-service) instead of localhost:8082.
Create the search-service Project: Implement the aggregator logic.
Update Frontend API calls: Change all axios calls to point to the API Gateway's address.
